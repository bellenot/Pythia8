   BASIC INSTALLATION

1) Once you have unpacked your tarball into a new (sub)directory,
   the first step is to run the "configure" script. If you accept the 
   default compiler options, and plan to run PYTHIA 8 standalone, you 
   only have to type "configure". This will create the file config.mk. 
   Actually, running this script by hand is optional since "make" will 
   run "configure" anyway, but possible errors in the paths will be 
   less clearly visible.

2) Type "gmake" or "make". This will create an archive library. 
   On Linux systems gmake and make are usually equivalent. For others, 
   in case of doubt, use gmake. This applies below as well.

3) The library should now be ready for use. To study some examples,
   go to the "examples" subdirectory. The README file in that 
   subdirectory contain further instructions how executables can 
   be built and run.
    
4) At any time, typing "gmake clean" will remove all temporary files
   (including the compiled PYTHIA 8 library) except any output files 
   you may have created during your test runs. (If you do it in the 
   main directory it will apply to all subdirectories, if in examples 
   then only for that subdirectory.)

   ADVANCED INSTALLATION

1) If you want to set various compilation options, or prepare the 
   linking to the HepMC external library then the "configure" script 
   will have to do more work. There are two different ways to 
   accomplish this.

1.1) If you have access to the CERN afs filesystem, so that libraries 
     can be picked up  from the /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external area, you 
     can run "configure"  with a suitable combination of the following 
     command-line arguments: 
     --help : prints a brief summary of the options described here.
     --enable-debug : turns on debugging flags and turns off optimization.
     --enable-shared : turns on shared-library creation,
         in addition to the archive libraries always built.
     --lcgplatform=xxx : allows you to specify the platform assumed for
         compilation, which also affects the assumed location of the 
         libraries below; default is slc3_ia32_gcc323 while other supported
         values for xxx include slc4_ia32_gcc34 and slc4_amd64_gcc34. 
     --with-hepmcversion=xxx : allows you later on to link to the HepMC
         library. The latest "old" version would be 1.27.02, while a 
         more modern one would be 2.00.02.
     --with-clhepversion=xxx : if you use HepMC version 1 you also need
         to link to CLHEP, e.g. HepMC 1.27.02 requires CLHEP 1.9.2.3-aa.
         HepMC version 2 does not require CLHEP.

1.2) If you want to use external libraries from some different location, 
     then you have to edit the "configure" file by hand before you run 
     it, to provide the paths where you have the respective libraries 
     installed on your local platform. Search in the "configure" file for
       HEPMCLOCATION
       CLHEPLOCATION

   Information on the selected paths is stored in the files 
   examples/config.sh and examples/config.csh when you run "configure".

2) If you want to change the versions of HepMC and/or CLHEP, you have to
   rerun the script "configure" with relevant options, then type "make" 
   to recompile the library hepmcinterface. If you tried already to run 
   examples with previous versions, pay attention to the environment 
   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (see README in examples).

3) If you have two CPUs or cores on your computer then using the -j2 
   option on make/gmake may speed up compilation.

4) Necessary data are automatically loaded when you use the default 
   PYTHIA installation directory structure and run the main programs in 
   the examples subdirectory. However, in the general case, you must 
   provide the path to the .xml files, originally stored in the xmldoc 
   directory, where default settings and particle data are found. This 
   can be done in two ways.

4.1) You can set the environment variable PYTHIA8DATA to contain the 
     location of the xmldoc directory. In the csh and tcsh shells this 
     could e.g. be
       setenv PYTHIA8DATA /home/myname/pythia8080/xmldoc
     while in other shells it could be
       export PYTHIA8DATA=/home/myname/pythia8080/xmldoc
     Recall that environment variables set locally are only defined in 
     the current instance of the shell. The above lines should go into 
     your .cshrc and .bashrc files, respectively, if you want a more 
     permanent assignment.

4.2) You can provide the path as argument to the Pythia constructor in 
     your main program, e.g.
       Pythia pythia("/home/myname/pythia8080/xmldoc");

   When PYTHIA8DATA is set it takes precedence, else the path in the 
   constructor is used, else one defaults to the ../xmldoc directory.

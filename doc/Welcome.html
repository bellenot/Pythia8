Important notes for the future:

Much remains to have a good Graphical User Interface in place. 
Outlined below is the sets of xml tags in current use, that 
would need to be implemented, and a few other open issues. 
(More will certainly appear with time.)

A) Standard html concepts:
<h1></h1> a top-level header
<h2></h2> a subheader
<h3></h3> a subsubheader
<h4></h4> a subsubsubheader
<br/> a new line
<p/> a new paragraph
<ol></ol> an ordered list, with <li> items
<ul></ul> a bulleted list, with <li> items
<li></li> an item in an ordered or bulleted list
<dl></dl> a definition list (used for references)
<dt></dt> a definition term in a definition list
<dd></dd> a definition text in a definition list
<b></b> boldface
<i></i> italics
<code></code> inline computer code (teletype font)
<pre></pre> a piece of code, with linebreaks as formatted (teletype font) 
<a href="..." target="..."></a> anchor
<frameset ....></frameset> : only used in Welcome.xml
<frame ....></frame> : only used in Welcome.xml
<img src="..." alt="..." hspace=... /> only used in Index.xml

B) New concepts for simple markup (no interactivity):
<chapter name="..."></chapter> a large chunk of text, 
    stored as one single xml file
<eq></eq> text to be displayed on a separate line, 
    centered if possible (a poor man's equation),
    maybe typeset in italics (<i>)
<ei></ei> inline variant of above
<ref></ref> reference to an article; replaced by [...].
<note></note> text begun on new line, in boldface
<file name="..."></file> name of a program file (new paragraph, boldface)
<class name="..."></class> information on a specific class,
    specifically the class creation command form.
<method name="..."></method> explanation of a class method.
<argument name="..." default="..."></argument> an argument of 
    the class creation or another method in the class, optionally 
    with a default value.
<argoption value="..."></argoption> further explanation of an 
    allowed option of an argument.   

C) New concepts for user interaction (but actually pretty similar to 
existing HTML concepts):
<flag name="..." default="..."></flag>
    a switch to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value, and have 
    the name and the new value written out to a file, as a line 
    in the format name = value. Allowed values are on (= yes, true)
    and off (= no, false), so it should be possible to select by 
    clicking on either of these two standard options.
    (implementation similar to radio buttons)
<mode name="..." default="..." min="..." max="..."></mode>
    an integer value to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value, and have 
    the name and the new value written out to a file, as a line 
    in the format name = value. Two possibilities: 
    * either a set of <option>'s exist, and it should then be
      possible to select by clicking on either of these
    (implementation similar to radio buttons), or else
    * an integer value can be written in a dialogue box.
    The min and max values are optional.
<option value="..."></option>
    a discrete set of options for a <mode>, see above.
<parm name="..." default="..." min="..." max="..."></parm>
    a double-precision value to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value continuously,
    in a dialogue box, and have the name and the new value written 
    out to a file, as a line in the format name = value.
    The min and max values are optional.
<particle id="..." name="..." antiName="..." spinType="..." chargeType="..." 
    colType="..." m0="..." mWidth="..." mMin="..." mMax="..." tau0="...">
    </particle>
    the properties of a particle, most of which are optional. It should be
    possible to change the current values, and have the changed values
    written back to file.
<channel onMode="..." bRatio="..." meMode="..." products="..."/></channel>
    the properties of a dec ay channel. This tag can only appear inside a
    <particle>...</particle> block. The meMode field is optional. The
    products appear as a blank-separated list. It should be possible to 
    change the current values, and have the changed values written back 
    to file.


D) Not yet covered aspects:
a) the possibility to save changed settings to a file, and later restore
   them from there, see SaveRestore.xml.
b) smarter way to handle references to articles?

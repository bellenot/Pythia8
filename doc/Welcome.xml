Important notes for the future:

Much remains to have a good Graphical User Interface in place. 
Outlined below is the sets of xml tags in current use, that 
would need to be implemented, and a few other open issues. 
(More will certainly appear with time.)

A) Standard html concepts:
<h1></h1> a top-level header
<h2></h2> a subheader
<h3></h3> a subsubheader
<br/> a new line
<p/> a new paragraph
<ol></ol> an ordered list, with <li> items
<ul></ul> a bulleted list, with <li> items
<li></li> an item in an ordered or bulleted list
<b></b> boldface
<code></code> inline computer code (teletype font)
<pre></pre> a piece of code, with linebreaks as formatted (teletype font) 
<a href="..." target="..."></a> anchor
<frameset ....></frameset> : only used in Welcome.xml
<frame ....></frame> : only used in Welcome.xml
<img src="..." alt="..." hspace=... /> only used in Index.xml

B) New concepts for simple markup (no interactivity):
<chapter name="..."></chapter> a large chunk of text, 
    stored as one single xml file
<eq></eq> text to be displayed on a separate line, 
    centered if possible (a poor man's equation),
    maybe typeset in italics (<i>)
<ei></ei> inline variant of above
<note></note> text begun on new line, in boldface
<file name="..."></file> name of a program file (new paragraph, boldface)
<class name="..."></class> information on a specific class,
    specifically the class creation command form.
<method name="..."></method> explanation of a class method.
<argument name="..." default="..."></argument> an argument of 
    the class creation or another method in the class, optionally 
    with a default value.
<argoption value="..."></argoption> further explanation of an 
    allowed option of an argument.   

C) New concepts for user interaction (but actually pretty similar to 
existing HTML concepts):
<flag name="..." default="...">
    a switch to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value, and have 
    the name and the new value written out to a file, as a line 
    in the format name = value. Allowed values are on (= yes, true)
    and off (= no, false), so it should be possible to select by 
    clicking on either of these two standard options.
    (implementation similar to radio buttons)
<mode name="..." default="..." min="..." max="..."></mode>
    an integer value to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value, and have 
    the name and the new value written out to a file, as a line 
    in the format name = value. Two possibilities: 
    * either a set of <option>'s exist, and it should then be
      possible to select by clicking on either of these
    (implementation similar to radio buttons), or else
    * an integer value can be written in a dialogue box.
    The min and max values are optional.
<option value="..."></option>
    a discrete set of options for a <mode>, see above.
<parameter name="..." default="..." min="..." max="..."></parameter>
    a double-precision value to be used in the event generation.
    It should be possible to change the current value continuously,
    in a dialogue box, and have the name and the new value written 
    out to a file, as a line in the format name = value.
    The min and max values are optional.

D) Not yet covered aspects:
a) particle decays 
b) the possibility to save changed settings to a file,
   see SaveRestore.xml.
c) smarter way to handle references to articles?

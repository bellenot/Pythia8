<h2>Event Analysis</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The routines in this section are intended to be used to analyze
event properties. As such they are not part of the main event
generation chain, but can be used in comparisons between Monte
Carlo events and real data. They are rather free-standing, but 
assume that input is provided in the PYTHIA 8 
<code>Event</code> format, and use a few basic facilities such 
as four-vectors.

<h3>Sphericity</h3>

The standard sphericity tensor is
<br/><i>
    S^{ab} = (sum_i p_i^a p_i^b) / (sum_i p_i^2)
</i><br/>
where the <i>sum i</i> runs over the particles in the event,
<i>a, b = x, y, z,</i> and <i>p</i> without such an index is 
the absolute size of the three-momentum . This tensor can be 
diagonalized to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

<p/>
The above tensor can be generalized by introducing a power 
<i>r</i>, such that
<br/><i>
    S^{ab} = (sum_i p_i^a p_i^b p_i^{r-2}) / (sum_i p_i^r)
</i><br/>
In particular, <i>r = 1</i> gives a linear dependence on momenta 
and thus a collinear safe definition, unlike sphericity.

<p/>
A sphericity analysis object is declared by
<p/><strong>
class name="Sphericity sph( power, select)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="power" default="2."</strong>:  
is the power <i>r</i> defined above, i.e. 
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2."</strong>: gives Spericity, and   
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1."</strong>: gives the linear form.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="select" default="2"</strong>:  
tells which particles are analyzed,
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: all final-state particles,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: all observable final-state particles, 
i.e. excluding neutrinos and other particles without strong or
electromagnetic interactions (the <code>isVisible()</code> 
particle method), and
  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="3"</strong>: only charged final-state particles.  
  
  

<p/>
The analysis is performed by a call to the method
<p/><strong>
method name="analyze( event)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="event"</strong>: is an object of the <code>Event</code> class, 
most likely the <code>pythia.event</code> one.
  
<br/>If the routine returns <code>false</code> the analysis failed, 
e.g. if too few particles are present to analyze.
  

<p/>
After the analysis has been performed, a few <code>Sphericity</code> 
class methods are available to return the result of the analysis:
<p/><strong>
method name="sphericity()"
</strong><br/>
gives the sphericity (or equivalent if <i>r</i> is not 2),
  
<p/><strong>
method name="aplanarity()" 
</strong><br/>
gives the aplanarity (with the same comment),
  
<p/><strong>
method name="eigenValue(i)" 
</strong><br/>
gives one of the three eigenvalues for <i>i</i> = 1, 2 or 3, in 
descending order,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="EventAxis(i)" 
</strong><br/>
gives the matching eigenvector, as a <code>Vec4</code> with vanishing 
time/energy component.
  
<p/><strong>
method name="list()" 
</strong><br/>
provides a listing of the above information.
  

<h3>Thrust</h3>

Thrust is obtained by varying the thrust axis so that the longitudinal
momentum component projected onto it is maximized, and thrust itself is 
then defined as the sum of absolute longitudinal momenta divided by
the sum of absolute momenta. The major axis is found correspondingly 
in the plane transverse to thrust, and the minor one is then defined 
to be transverse to both. Oblateness is the difference between the major 
and the minor values. 

<p/>
The calculation of thrust is more computer-time-intensive than e.g. 
linear sphericity, introduced above, and has no specific advantages except 
historical precedent. In the Pythia6 implementation the search was 
speeded up at the price of then not being guaranteed to hit the absolute
maximum. The current implementation studies all possibilities, but at
the price of being slower, with time consumption for an event with
<i>n</i> particles growing like <i>n^3</i>.

<p/>
A thrust analysis object is declared by
<p/><strong>
class name="Thrust thr( select)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="select" default="2"</strong>:  
tells which particles are analyzed,
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: all final-state particles,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: all observable final-state particles, 
i.e. excluding neutrinos and other particles without strong or
electromagnetic interactions (the <code>isVisible()</code> 
particle method), and
  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="3"</strong>: only charged final-state particles.  
  
  

<p/>
The analysis is performed by a call to the method
<p/><strong>
method name="analyze( event)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="event"</strong>: is an object of the <code>Event</code> class, 
most likely the <code>pythia.event</code> one.
  
<br/>If the routine returns <code>false</code> the analysis failed, 
e.g. if too few particles are present to analyze.
  

<p/>
After the analysis has been performed, a few <code>Thrust</code> 
class methods are available to return the result of the analysis:
<p/><strong>
method name="thrust(), tMajor(), tMinor(), oblateness()"
</strong><br/>
gives the thrust, major, minor and oblateness values, respectively, 
<p/><strong>
method name="EventAxis(i)" 
</strong><br/>
gives the matching event-axis vectors, for <i>i</i> = 1, 2 or 3
corresponding to thrust, major or minor, as a <code>Vec4</code> with 
vanishing time/energy component.
  
<p/><strong>
method name="list()" 
</strong><br/>
provides a listing of the above information.
  

<h3>ClusterJet</h3>

<code>ClusterJet</code> (a.k.a. <code>LUCLUS</code> and 
<code>PYCLUS</code>) is a clustering algorithm of the type used for 
analyses of <i>e^+e^-</i> events, see the PYTHIA 6 manual. A few 
options are available for some well-known distance measures. Cutoff 
distances can either be given in terms of a scaled quadratic quantity 
like <i>y = pT^2/E^2</i> or an unscaled linear one like <i>pT</i>. 

<p/>
A cluster-jet analysis object is declared by
<p/><strong>
class name="ClusterJet clusterJet( measure, select, massSet,
precluster, reassign)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="measure" default="Lund"</strong>: distance measure, to be provided
as a character string (actually, only the first character is necessary)
<br/><strong>
argoption value="Lund"</strong>: the Lund <i>pT</i> distance,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="JADE"</strong>: the JADE mass distance, and  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="Durham"</strong>: the Durham <i>kT</i> measure.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="select" default="2"</strong>:  
tells which particles are analyzed,
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: all final-state particles,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: all observable final-state particles, 
i.e. excluding neutrinos and other particles without strong or
electromagnetic interactions (the <code>isVisible()</code> particle 
method), and
  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="3"</strong>: only charged final-state particles.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="massSet" default="2"</strong>: masses assumed for the particles 
used in the analysis
<br/><strong>
argoption value="0"</strong>: all massless,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: photons are massless while all others are
assigned the <i>pi+-</i> mass, and
  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: all given their correct masses.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="precluster" default="false"</strong>: 
perform or not a early preclustering step, where nearby particles
are lumped together so as to speed up the subsequent normal clustering.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="reassign" default="false"</strong>:  
reassign all particles to the nearest jet each time after two jets
have been joined. 
  
  

<p/>
The analysis is performed by a
<p/><strong>
method name="analyze( event, yScale, pTscale, nJetMin, nJetMax)" 
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="event"</strong>: is an object of the <code>Event</code> class, 
most likely the <code>pythia.event</code> one.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="yScale"</strong>:  
is the cutoff joining scale, below which jets are joined. Is given
in quadratic dimensionless quantities. Either <code>yScale</code>
or <code>pTscale</code> must be set nonvanishing, and the larger of 
the two dictates the actual value.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="pTscale"</strong>:  
is the cutoff joining scale, below which jets are joined. Is given
in linear quantities, such as <i>pT</i> or <i>m</i> depending on
the measure used, but always in units of GeV. Either <code>yScale</code>
or <code>pTscale</code> must be set nonvanishing, and the larger of 
the two dictates the actual value.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="nJetMin" default="1"</strong>:  
the mimimum number of jets to be reconstructed. If used, it can override 
the <code>yScale</code> and <code>pTscale</code> values. 
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="nJetMax" default="0"</strong>:  
the maximum number of jets to be reconstructed. Is not used if below
<code>nJetMin</code>. If used, it can override the <code>yScale</code>
and <code>pTscale</code> values. Thus e.g. 
<code>nJetMin = nJetMax = 3</code> can be used to reconstruct exactly
3 jets.
  
<br/>If the routine returns <code>false</code> the analysis failed, 
e.g. because the number of particles was smaller than the minimum number
of jets requested.
  

<p/>
After the analysis has been performed, a few <code>ClusterJet</code> 
class methods are available to return the result of the analysis:
<p/><strong>
method name="size()"
</strong><br/>
gives the number of jets found,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="p(i)"
</strong><br/>
gives a <code>Vec4</code> corresponding to the four-momentum defined by 
the sum of all the contributing particles to the <i>i</i>'th jet,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="jetAssignment(i)"
</strong><br/>
gives the index of the jet that the particle <i>i</i> of the event
record belongs to,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="list()"
</strong><br/>
provides a listing of the reconstructed jets.
  

<h3>CellJet</h3>

<code>CellJet</code> (a.k.a. <code>PYCELL</code>) is a simple cone jet 
finder in the UA1 spirit, see the PYTHIA 6 manual. It works in an 
<i>(eta, phi, eT)</i> space, where <i>eta</i> is pseudorapidity, 
<i>phi</i> azimuthal angle and <i>eT</i> transverse energy.
It will draw cones in <i>R = sqrt(Delta-eta^2 + Delta-phi^2)</i> 
around seed cells. If the total <i>eT</i> inside the cone exceeds 
the threshold, a jet is formed, and the cells are removed from further 
analysis. There are no split or merge procedures, so later-found jet 
may be missing some of the edge regions already used up by previous 
ones.   

<p/>
A cell-jet analysis object is declared by
<p/><strong>
class name="CellJet cellJet( etaMax, nEta, nPhi, select, smear, 
resolution, upperCut, threshold)"
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="etaMax" default="5."</strong>:  
the maximum +-pseudorapidity that the detector is assumed to cover.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="nEta" default="50"</strong>:  
the number of equal-sized bins that the <i>+-etaMax</i> range 
is assumed to be divided into.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="nPhi" default="32"</strong>:  
the number of equal-sized bins that the <i>phi</i> range 
<i>+-pi</i> is assumed to be divided into. 
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="select" default="2"</strong>:  
tells which particles are analyzed,
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: all final-state particles,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: all observable final-state particles, 
i.e. excluding neutrinos and other particles without strong or
electromagnetic interactions (the <code>isVisible()</code> particle 
method), 
and  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="3"</strong>: only charged final-state particles.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="smear" default="0"</strong>: 
strategy to smear the actual <i>eT</i> bin by bin, 
<br/><strong>
argoption value="0"</strong>: no smearing,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="1"</strong>: smear the <i>eT</i> according to a Gaussian 
with width <i>resolution * sqrt(eT)</i>, with the Gaussian truncated 
at 0 and <i>upperCut * eT</i>,  
<br/><strong>
argoption value="2"</strong>: smear the <i>e = eT * cosh(eta)</i> according 
to a Gaussian with width <i>resolution * sqrt(e)</i>, with the 
Gaussian truncated at 0 and <i>upperCut * e</i>.  
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="resolution" default="0.5"</strong>: 
see above
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="upperCut" default="2."</strong>: 
see above
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="threshold" default="0 GeV"</strong>: 
completely neglect all bins with an <i>eT &lt; threshold</i>.
  
  

<p/>
The analysis is performed by a
<p/><strong>
method name="analyze( event, eTjetMin, coneRadius, eTseed)" 
</strong><br/>
where 
<br/><strong>
argument name="event"</strong>: is an object of the <code>Event</code> class, 
most likely the <code>pythia.event</code> one.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="eTjetMin" default="20. GeV"</strong>:  
is the minimum transverse energy inside a cone for this to be 
accepted as a jet.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="coneRadius" default="0.7"</strong>:  
 is the size of the cone in <i>(eta, phi)</i> space drawn around 
the geometric center of the jet.
  
<br/><strong>
argument name="eTseed" default="1.5 GeV"</strong>:  
the mimimum <i>eT</i> in a cell for this to be acceptable as 
the trial center of a jet. 
  
<br/>If the routine returns <code>false</code> the analysis failed, 
but currently this is not foreseen ever to happen.

<p/><strong>
method name="pMassive(i)"
</strong><br/>
gives a <code>Vec4</code> corresponding to the four-momentum defined by 
the sum of all the contributing cells to the <i>i</i>'th jet, where 
each cell contributes a four-momentum as if all the <i>eT</i> is 
deposited in the center of the cell,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="m(i)"
</strong><br/>
gives the invariant mass of the <i>i</i>'th jet, defined by the 
<code>pMassive</code> above,
  
<p/><strong>

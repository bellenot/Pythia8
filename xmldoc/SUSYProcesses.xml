<h2>SUSY Processes</h2>

The implementation of SUSY processes is barely begun, so this page
is more a placeholder than a repository of useful processes.
Even the processes that have been implemented are not yet fully handled.

<p/>
Here is collected processes involving supersymmetric particle 
production, with the exception of the (extended) Higgs sector.
Since the number of separate but closely related processes is so big,
there will not be switches for each separate process but only for a
reasonable set of subgroups.

<br/><note>Important note:</note> 
In order to simulate SUSY processes it is required to read in the 
couplings and masses relevant for the scenario to be studied. This 
is done with the help of the SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA). The 
reading of a relevant SLHA file <b>must</b> be set up, as described 
on <aloc href="SUSYLesHouchesAccord">this page</aloc>.

<flag name="SUSY:all" default="off">
Common switch for production of supersymmetric particles, i.e. 
particles with R-parity -1. 
</flag>

<flag name="SUSY:qqbar2chi0chi0" default="off">
Pair production of neutralinos by quark-antiquark annihilation. With
four neutralino species this gives ten separate processes, codes 1201
- 1210. The current implementation is in a development stage and does
not include contributions from diagrams with intermediate squarks,
hence the correct answer is only obtained in the limit of infinitely heavy
squarks. As yet, there are also no sparticle decays implemented - 
all neutralinos decay to Gravitino+photon.

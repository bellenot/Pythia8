<h2>Update History</h2>

These update notes describe major updates relative to the baseline 
PYTHIA 8.100 version. However, they are less extensive than the 
corresponding update notes for PYTHIA 6. There are three main 
reasons for this:

<ul>

<li>The manual contained on these html/php pages is kept up to date.
(However, the "Brief Introduction" may not always be.)</li>

<li>8.1 is a quite new code, so there are many minor changes that, 
if all were to be documented, would hide the key ones.</li>

<li>8.1 is not yet used for "mission critical" applications, 
so there is less need to trace changed behaviour.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Main news by version</h3>

<ul>

<li>8.105: 24 February 2008
<ul>

<li>New option to initialize with arbitrary beam directions<br/>
<code>pythia.init( idA, idB, pxA, pyA, pzA, pxB, pyB, pzB)</code></li>

<li>Added capability to set <a href="BeamParameters.html" target="page">beam energy spread 
and beam vertex</a>.
<br/>
<b>Warning:</b> as a consequence, the old <code>Beams</code> group of 
settings has been moved to <code>BeamRemnants</code>, and 
<code>Beams</code> is now instead used for machine beam parameters. 
Therefore also some <code>Main</code> settings of this character have been 
regrouped, as follows:
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr> <td>8.100 setting  </td> <td>has been moved to </td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:idA          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:idA         </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:idB          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:idB         </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:inCMframe    </code></td>
     <td>(<code>Beams:frameType</code>) </td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:eCM          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:eCM         </code></td> </tr>

     <td><code>Beams:eA          </code></td> </tr>

<tr> <td><code>Main:LHEF         </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:LHEF        </code></td> </tr>
</table></li>

<li>The <code>forceHadronLevel()</code> method introduced for standalone 
hadronization.</li>

<li><code>main15.cc</code> illustrated how either full hadronization or 
only decays of some particles can be looped over for the rest of the 
event retained.</li>

<li>The <code>LHAevnt</code> and <code>LHAinit</code> classes have been 
joined into a new <code>LHAup</code> one, with new options that allow 
the writing of a Les Houches Event File.</li>

<li>The <code>SusyLesHouches</code> class updated to handle 
SLHA version 2.</li>

<li>Updated HepMC conversion routine.</li>

<li>The static <code>ErrorMsg</code> class has been removed and 
its functionality moved into the non-static <code>Info</code> class,
in the renamed Info file.</li>

<li>Further reduction of the use of static, with related code changes.
This should allow to have several almost independent <code>Pythia</code> 
instances. Some static classes still remain, however, notably for
random number generation and particle properties.</li>

<li>Limited capability to use two different <code>Pythia</code> instances 
for signal + pileup event generation, see <code>main19.cc</code> for an 
example.</li> 

<li>In the <code>Event</code> class the <code>=</code> and 
<code>=+</code> methods have been overloaded to allow the copying 
or appending of event records. Illustrated in <code>main19.cc</code>.</li>

<li>The html and php page formatting improved with 
cascading style sheets.</li>

<li>Several minor improvements and new options, including updated configure 
scripts.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.108: 1 May 2008
<ul>

<li>Correction in the event record, so that the beam particles in line 
1 and 2 do not have any mother according to the <code>motherList</code>
method. Previously the "system" entry in line 0 was counted as their 
mother, which gave rise to an unexpected extra vertex in the conversion 
to the HepMC format.</li>

<li>Support for HepMC version 1 is removed, to simplify the code and 
reflect the evolution of the field.</li>

<li>Status codes are stored in HepMC only as 1 for existing and 2 for
decayed or fragmented particles (whereas previously the original PYTHIA
codes were used for the latter).</li>

<li>Parton densities are stored in HepMC as <i>xf(x,Q^2)</i> 
rather than the <i>f(x,Q^2)</i> used in (some) previous versions.</li>

<li>The SusyLesHouches class has ben updated so that reading is fully
compatible with the SLHA2 standard. </li>

<li>Improved handling of the Higgs width, relevant for massive and thereby
broad resonance shapes.</li>

<li>The matrix elements for neutralino pair production have now been
completed and checked.</li>

<li>Ensure that <i>alpha_strong</i> does not blow up, by introducing 
a minimal scale somewhat above <i>Lambda_3</i> (roughly where
<i>alpha_strong = 10</i>).</li>

<li>New methods <code>isValence1()</code> and <code>isValence2()</code> 
in the <code>Info</code> class.</li>

<li>Protection against division by zero in calculation of decay vertex
(for zero-mass gluons with zero lifetime, where there should be no
displacement).</li>

<li>A new compilation option <code>-Wshadow</code> is introduced and 
code is rewritten at all places where this option gave warnings.</li>

<li>Minor library correction to allow compilation with gcc 4.3.0.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.114: 22 October 2008
<ul>

<li>New rescattering description operational (but still experimental) 
for the case that FSR is not interleaved, but saved until after MI, 
ISR and beam remnants have been handled. This involves much new code
in several classes.</li>

<li>A new class <code>PartonSystems</code> is introduced to 
keep track of which partons in the event record belong to which 
subcollision system, plus some further information on each subsystem.
It takes over functionality previously found as part of the 
<code>Event</code> class, but leaves room for future growth.</li>

<li>Add optional model, wherein an increased <i>pT0</i> turnoff scale 
for MI and ISR is used for above-average active events, i.e. events that 
already have several MI's or ISR emissions.</li>

<li>Freeze GRV 94L distribution at small <i>Q^2</i> to avoid blowup.</li>

<li>The <code>pythia.readFile(...)</code> method can now alternatively take 
an <code>istream</code> as argument instead of a <code>filename</code>.</li>

<li>Minor bug correction in <code>PartonLevel.cc</code>; the bug could 
(rarely) give a segmentation fault.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.120: 10 March 2009
<ul>

<li>New rescattering description further developed, but not yet
recommended for normal usage.</li>

<li>Include new processes for Large Extra Dimensions and Unparticles,
contributed by Stefan Ask. New test program <code>main28.cc</code> 
illustrates.</li>

<li>Include further SUSY processes: neutralino-chargino and 
chargino-chargino pairs. The processes should be valid also 
in the case of non-minimal flavour violation and/or CP violation.
Expanded machinery to keep track of SUSY parameters.</li>

<li>Include backwards evolution of incoming photon as part of the
<code>SpaceShower</code> initial-state radiation description. This
allows you to simulate hard collisions where one of the incoming
partons is a photon. New test program <code>main43.cc</code> 
illustrates.</li>

<li>Allow separate mass and transverse momentum cuts when two hard 
subprocesses are generated in the same event.</li>

<li>The default value for the border between short- and long-lived
paticles has been changed from 1 mm to 10 mm, to better conform with 
LHC standards, see  <a href="ParticleDecays.html" target="page">here</a>.
The default is still to let all unstable particles decay.</li>

<li>New ISR matrix-element correction to <i>f -&gt; f gamma</i> 
in single <i>W</i> production.</li>

<li>New method <code>Event::statusHepMC</code> returns the status 
code according to the HepMC conventions agreed in February 2009.
The interface to HepMC now writes out status according to this 
convention.</li>

<li>Add capability to link to FastJet, with expanded configure script 
and Makefile, and with <code>main61.cc</code> as new example.</li>

<li>Update of <code>Makefile.msc</code>, with added support for latest 
Visual C++ Express edition and use of regexp to check nmake version.</li>

<li>Update of <code>LHAFortran.h</code> and 
<code>Pythia6Interface.h</code>, to make the interface to Fortran 
routines work also under Windows. (Thanks to Anton Karneyeu.)

<li>Updated and expanded worksheet.</li>

<li>The manual pages in the <code>xmldoc</code> directory, and thereby
also those of the <code>htmldoc</code> and <code>phpdoc</code>
directories, have been significantly updated and expanded. In particular, 
in many places the class of each method is explicitly shown, as well as 
the type of the return value and of the arguments. This upgrade is not 
yet completed, but already covers the more relevant sections. </li>

<li>The unary minus operator in the <code>Vec4()</code> returns a 
reference to a four-vector with all components negated, but leaves 
the original four-vector unchanged. Previously the four-vector itself
was flipped.</li>

<li>The <code>pPlus()</code> and <code>pMinus()</code> methods of a
four-vector and an event-record particle are renamed <code>pPos()</code> 
and <code>pNeg()</code>, respectively.</li>

<li>Include a further loop in <code>ProcessLevel</code>, so that a new
process is generated in case of failures of a less severe nature.</li>

<li>Introduce warning message for unexpected <code>meMode</code> in
<code>ResonanceWidths</code>.</li>

<li>Les Houches event reading framework has been rearranged for
more flexibility. Some bugs corrected. Specifically, when scale 
is not set (<code>scale = -1.</code> in the Les Houches standard),
PYTHIA did not attempt to set this scale itself, which typically 
lead to there not being any ISR or FSR. Now the 
<a href="CouplingsAndScales.html" target="page">rules for normal 
1-, 2- and 3-body final states</a> are applied, with a trivial
extension of the 3-body rules for higher multiplicities.</li>

<li>Correct bug in the handling of parton densities, whereby it was
not possible to switch to a new set, once a first initialization
had been done.</li>

<li>Correct bugs when several <code>Pythia::init</code> initialization
calls are made in the same run, specifically in the case that pointers
to external processes have been handed in.

<li>Changes in main03.cmnd and main04.cmnd so that some nonstandard 
options are commented ou rather than active. Related comments
inserted also in some other .cmnd files, but there without any change 
in program execution.</li>

<li>A few further minor bug fixes.</li>

<li>Update year to 2009.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.125: 16 June 2009
<ul>

<li>Hadronization and timlike-shower parameter default values updated 
according to a tune to LEP1 data by Hendrik Hoeth, using the 
Rivet + Professor framework.</li>

<li>Many further SUSY production processes. SLHA readin expanded to cover 
also masses and decay modes. Example <code>main22</code> updated, while 
<code>main33</code> now superfluous and removed. </li>

<li>Also further processes for extra dimensions.</li>

<li>Stefan Ask joins as coauthor.</li>

<li>The <code>TimeShower::shower(...)</code> method has gained
a new argument, that forces the shower evolution to stop after
a given number of branchings. A new method 
<code>TimeShower::pTLastInShower()</code> permits the last evolution
<i>pT</i> to be read out. These extensions can be useful 
for matching studies.
</li>

<li>New optional argument <code>isInterleaved</code> added to 
<code>TimeShower::branch(...)</code>. Is false by default, but
true when called from the parton level for interleaved evolution
of several parton systems, optionally also with ISR and MI.</li>

<li>New methods <code>UserHooks::canSetResonanceScale()</code>
and <code>UserHooks:scaleResonance(...)</code> allows an optional 
user choice of the maximum shower scale in resonance decays.</li>

<li>A new method <code>SpaceShower::doRestart()</code> has been 
added, to help distinguish cases when a
<code>SpaceShower::branch(...)</code> failure forces a complete
restart of the evolution from ones where only the intended
current branching has been vetoed.

<li>When multiple interactions are initialized, it is now 
possible to reduce both <i>pT0</i> and <i>pTmin</i>
if necessary to find a valid solution where 
<i>sigma_jet &gt; sigma_nondiffractive</i>. Previously
only the former would be reduced, which could lead to 
infinite loops if too large a <i>pTmin</i> was used.
Thanks to Sami Kama for pointing out the problem.
</li>

<li>The rescattering machinery is now essentially completed, and can
be used also by others than the authors. For now, however, it can only
be recommended for dedicated studies, not e.g. for generic tunes.
</li>

<li>Timelike and spacelike showers, and beam remnant handling, 
are modified to handle rescattering partons. Specifically, a new machinery 
is introduced to trace the recoils from the combination of rescattering 
with showers and primordial <i>kT</i>. Can assign space- or timelike 
virtualities to intermediate particles to have energy and momentum 
conserved locally. This affects the <code>PartonLevel</code>, 
<code>MultipleInteractions</code>, <code>TimeShower</code>, 
<code>SpaceShowe</code>r and <code>BeamRemnants</code> classes. 
Further details to appear in the upcoming article on rescattering. 
(Another change is a reversal to pre-8.114 order for non-interleaved FSR,
wherein also FSR is treated before beam remnants are attached.)
</li>

<li>Four new status codes introduced, as part of the rescattering 
description:
<br/>45 : incoming rescattered parton, with changed kinematics owing
to ISR in the mother system (cf. status 34);
<br/>46 : incoming copy of recoiler when this is a rescattered parton
(cf. status 42);
<br/>54 : copy of a recoiler, when in the initial state of a different 
system from the radiator;
<br/>55 : copy of a recoiler, when in the final state of a different 
system from the radiator.
</li>

<li>New method <code>Info::tooLowPTmin()</code> can tell whether the 
<i>pTmin</i> scales for showers or multiple interactions are too low. 
</li>

<li>Pion beams allowed, both <i>pi^+</i>, <i>pi^-</i> and 
<i>pi^0</i>. New machinery for the latter, where the valence 
flavour content is chosen to be either <i>d dbar</i> or 
<i>u ubar</i> for each new event. One internal pion PDF 
implemented, with others from LHAPDF.</li>

<li>Treatment of Pomeron-proton collisions begun.</li>

<li>Phase-space handling of hard processes and multiple interactions
slightly expanded to better allow for harder PDF's than proton ones,
e.g. for Pomerons.</li>

<li>The program documentation has been expanded with an
alphabetical index of all methods that are described on the 
webpages, see the <a href="ProgramMethods.html" target="page">Program Methods</a> 
page. Also other sections of the documentation have been
updated and expanded, including the worksheet.</li>

<li>Several <code>list</code> methods have been made 
<code>const</code>. For the listing of events two new methods
have been added, <code>Event::list()</code> and 
<code>Event::list(bool showScaleAndVertex, 
bool showMothersAndDaughters = false)</code>,
that correspond to special cases of the general method.</li>

<li>A new method <code>Pythia::LHAeventSkip(int nSkip)</code>
permits a skip-ahead of the reading of external Les Houches 
Events, without the necessity to generate the intervening 
<code>nSkip</code> events in full. Makes use of the new 
<code>LHAup::skipEvent(int nSkip)</code> method to perform 
the operations. Mainly intended for debug purposes.

<li>The <code>ClusterJet</code> jet finder now saves the last
five clustering scales. Also a minor bug fix. Thanks to Nils 
Lavesson for this contribution.</li>

<li>The <code>Particle::m2()</code> method now returns a negative 
number when the stored mass <i>m</i> is negative, as used to 
indicate spacelike virtualities. Also the 
<code>Particle::eCalc()</code>, <code>Particle::mT()</code> and
<code>Particle::mT2()</code> methods have been modified.
</li>

<li>The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> method to print our a four-vector has 
been expanded with a fifth number, the invariant length, with a minus
sign for spacelike vectors, and provided within brackets to allow
a simple visual distinction.</li>

<li>New methods <code>Rndm::dumpState(string fileName)</code> and
<code>Rndm::readState(string fileName)</code> allows to write or
read the state of the random number generator to or from a binary file.
</li>

<li>New method <code>double GammaReal(double x)</code> returns the 
value of the <i>Gamma</i> function for arbitrary real argument.
Some cross sections for extra-dimensional processes rewritten to
make use of it.
</li>

<li>New example program <code>main29</code> shows how 
to set up a fictitious process of a heavy system decaying
to two particles or partons, with decays traced to stable
particles, as relevant for astroparticle applications.</li>

<li>Main programs that illustrate the HepMC interface have
been updated to use version 2.04, including units and excluding
deprecated output formats.</li>

<li>The <code>main32</code> example extended also to handle 
Les Houches Event Files.</li>

<li>The Makefile has been modified so that "make clean" only
removes the current compilation and library fles, while 
"make distclean" gives a more extensive reset and cleanup.
Thanks to Nils Lavesson for this contribution. Some other
minor Makefile corrections.</li>

<li>Several main programs that use the 
<code>Main:timesToShow</code> mode have been corrected so as 
not to crash if this is set to zero. Also some other cosmetics
changes in main programs that do not affect the running.</li>

<li>Bug correction, in that previously a veto with user hooks 
was not propagated from parton showers inside resonance decays.
</li>

<li>Minor bug fix in <code>TimeShower</code> for kinematics with 
unequal beam-particle masses.</li>

<li>Bug fix so that <code>PartonLevel:MI = off</code> also works for 
minimum-bias events.</li>

<li>Minor bug fix in the impact-parameter selection of multiple 
interactions. Thanks to Sami Kama for pointing it out.</li>

<li>String fragmentation for junction topology protected against 
numerical instability in boost.</li>

<li>Bug correction in the handling of particle decays to partons,
where the scale of the partons was set before the partons had been
added to some arrays, leading to indexation out of bounds. 
Thanks to Vladislav Burylov for discovering this bug.
</li>

<li>Bug correction in the handling of particles with inhibited decay, 
where the decay vertex would be too far displaced, which could lead to
infinite loop. Thanks to Sami Kama for debugging this. </li>

<li>Check to avoid infinite loop in matrix-element handling of 
two-body decays.</li>

<li>Bug correction to avoid infinite loops in Dalitz decay treatment.
Some changes in the decay handling logic to allow a new try when the 
decay of a particle fails.</li>

<li>Minor correction, so the pointer to the <code>Info</code> class
is set also for user-written classes derived from <code>LHAup</code>. 
</li>

<li>Correction for typo in the matrix element of the
<code>Sigma3ff2HchgchgfftWW</code> class, for doubly charged Higgs
production. Thanks to Merlin Kole for spotting it.</li>

<li>Updated colour bookkeeping in junction-antijunction annihilation 
avoids later problems in <code>Pythia::check()</code>. </li>

<li>Minor updates of the <code>Makefile.msc</code> file to work with 
Visual Studio 2008. Thanks to David Bailey for these modifications.</li>

<li>Ensure that <code>nInit</code> in the <code>BeamParticle</code>
class is set also for unresolved lepton beams.</li>

<li>The <code>VetoEvolution</code> class, derived from 
<code>UserHooks</code>, is obsolete and has been removed.</li>

</ul>
</li>

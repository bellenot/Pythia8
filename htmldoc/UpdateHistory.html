<h2>Update History</h2>

These update notes describe major updates relative to the baseline 
PYTHIA 8.100 version. However, they are less extensive than the 
corresponding update notes for PYTHIA 6. There are three main 
reasons for this:

<ul>

<li>The manual contained on these html/php pages is kept up to date.
(However, the "Brief Introduction" may not always be.)</li>

<li>8.1 is a quite new code, so there are many minor changes that, 
if all were to be documented, would hide the key ones.</li>

<li>8.1 is not yet used for "mission critical" applications, 
so there is less need to trace changed behaviour.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Main news by version</h3>

<ul>

<li>8.101: 10 November 2007
<ul>

<li>New option to initialize with arbitrary beam directions<br/>
<code>pythia.init( idA, idB, pxA, pyA, pzA, pxB, pyB, pzB)</code></li>

<li>The <code>LHAevnt</code> and <code>LHAinit</code> classes have been 
joined into a new <code>LHAup</code> one, with new options that allow 
the writing of a Les Houches Event File.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.102: 6 December 2007
<ul>

<li>Limited capability to use two different <code>Pythia</code> instances 
for signal + pileup event generation, see <code>main19.cc</code> for an 
example.</li> 

<li>Added capability to set <a href="BeamParameters.html" target="page">beam energy spread 
and beam vertex</a>.
<br/>
<b>Warning:</b> as a consequence, the old <code>Beams</code> group of 
settings has been moved to <code>BeamRemnants</code>, and 
<code>Beams</code> is now instead used for machine beam parameters. 
Therefore also some <code>Main</code> settings of this character have been 
regrouped, as follows:
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr> <td>8.100 setting  </td> <td>has been moved to </td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:idA          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:idA         </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:idB          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:idB         </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:inCMframe    </code></td>
     <td>(<code>Beams:frameType</code>) </td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:eCM          </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:eCM         </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:eA           </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:eA          </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:eB           </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:eB          </code></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><code>Main:LHEF         </code></td>
     <td><code>Beams:LHEF        </code></td> </tr>
</table></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.103: 22 January 2008
<ul>

<li>Updated HepMC conversion routine.</li>

<li>In the <code>Event</code> class the <code>=</code> and 
<code>=+</code> methods have been overloaded to allow the copying 
or appending of event records. Illustrated in <code>main19.cc</code>.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.104: 14 February 2008
<ul>

<li>Updated configure scripts.</li>

<li>The <code>SusyLesHouches</code> class updated to handle 
SLHA version 2.</li>

<li>The <code>forceHadronLevel()</code> method introduced for standalone 
hadronization.</li>

<li><code>main15.cc</code> illustrated how either full hadronization or 
only decays of some particles can be looped over for the rest of the 
event retained.</li>

<li>The html and php page formatting improved with 
cascading style sheets.</li>

<li>The static <code>ErrorMsg</code> class has been removed and 
its functionality moved into the non-static <code>Info</code> class,
in the renamed Info file.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.105: 24 February 2008
<ul>

<li>Further reduction of the use of static, with related code changes.
This should allow to have several almost independent <code>Pythia</code> 
instances. Some static classes still remain, however, notably for
random number generation and particle properties.</li>

<li>Several minor improvements and new options.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.106: 11 March 2008
<ul>

<li>Improved handling of the Higgs width, relevant for massive and thereby
broad resonance shapes.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.107: 17 March 2008
<ul>

<li>Correction in the event record, so that the beam particles in line 
1 and 2 do not have any mother according to the <code>motherList</code>
method. Previously the "system" entry in line 0 was counted as their 
mother, which gave rise to an unexpected extra vertex in the conversion 
to the HepMC format.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.108: 1 May 2008
<ul>

<li>Support for HepMC version 1 is removed, to simplify the code and 
reflect the evolution of the field.</li>

<li>Status codes are stored in HepMC only as 1 for existing and 2 for
decayed or fragmented particles (whereas previously the original PYTHIA
codes were used for the latter).</li>

<li>Parton densities are stored in HepMC as <i>xf(x,Q^2)</i> 
rather than the <i>f(x,Q^2)</i> used in (some) previous versions.</li>

<li>The SusyLesHouches class has ben updated so that reading is fully
compatible with the SLHA2 standard. </li>

<li>The matrix elements for neutralino pair production have now been
completed and checked.</li>

<li>A new compilation option <code>-Wshadow</code> is introduced and 
code is rewritten at all places where this option gave warnings.</li>

<li>Minor library correction to allow compilation with gcc 4.3.0.</li>

<li>Ensure that <i>alpha_strong</i> does not blow up, by introducing 
a minimal scale somewhat above <i>Lambda_3</i> (roughly where
<i>alpha_strong = 10</i>).</li>

<li>New methods <code>isValence1()</code> and <code>isValence2()</code> 
in the <code>Info</code> class.</li>

<li>Protection against division by zero in calculation of decay vertex
(for zero-mass gluons with zero lifetime, where there should be no
displacement).</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.114: 22 October 2008
<ul>

<li>New rescattering description operational (but still experimental) 
for the case that FSR is not interleaved, but saved until after MI, 
ISR and beam remnants have been handled. This involves much new code
in several classes.</li>

<li>A new class <code>PartonSystems</code> is introduced to 
keep track of which partons in the event record belong to which 
subcollision system, plus some further information on each subsystem.
It takes over functionality previously found as part of the 
<code>Event</code> class, but leaves room for future growth.</li>

<li>Add optional model, wherein an increased <i>pT0</i> turnoff scale 
for MI and ISR is used for above-average active events, i.e. events that 
already have several MI's or ISR emissions.</li>

<li>Freeze GRV 94L distribution at small <i>Q^2</i> to avoid blowup.</li>

<li>The <code>pythia.readFile(...)</code> method can now alternatively take 
an <code>istream</code> as argument instead of a <code>filename</code>.</li>

<li>Minor bug correction in <code>PartonLevel.cc</code>; the bug could 
(rarely) give a segmentation fault.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>8.120: 10 March 2009
<ul>

<li>New rescattering description further developed, but not yet
recommended for normal usage.</li>

<li>Include new processes for Large Extra Dimensions and Unparticles,
contributed by Stefan Ask. New test program <code>main28.cc</code> 
illustrates.</li>

<li>Include further SUSY processes: neutralino-chargino and 
chargino-chargino pairs. The processes should be valid also 
in the case of non-minimal flavour violation and/or CP violation.
Expanded machinery to keep track of SUSY parameters.</li>

<li>Include backwards evolution of incoming photon as part of the
<code>SpaceShower</code> initial-state radiation description. This
allows you to simulate hard collisions where one of the incoming
partons is a photon. New test program <code>main43.cc</code> 
illustrates.</li>

<li>Allow separate mass and transverse momentum cuts when two hard 
subprocesses are generated in the same event.</li>

<li>The default value for the border between short- and long-lived
paticles has been changed from 1 mm to 10 mm, to better conform with 
LHC standards, see  <a href="ParticleDecays.html" target="page">here</a>.
The default is still to let all unstable particles decay.</li>

<li>New ISR matrix-element correction to <i>f -&gt; f gamma</i> 
in single <i>W</i> production.</li>

<li>New method <code>Event::statusHepMC</code> returns the status 
code according to the HepMC conventions agreed in February 2009.
The interface to HepMC now writes out status according to this 
convention.</li>

<li>Add capability to link to FastJet, with expanded configure script 
and Makefile, and with <code>main61.cc</code> as new example.</li>

<li>Update of <code>Makefile.msc</code>, with added support for latest 
Visual C++ Express edition and use of regexp to check nmake version.</li>

<li>Update of <code>LHAFortran.h</code> and 
<code>Pythia6Interface.h</code>, to make the interface to Fortran 
routines work also under Windows. (Thanks to Anton Karneyeu.)

<li>Updated and expanded worksheet.</li>

<li>The manual pages in the <code>xmldoc</code> directory, and thereby
also those of the <code>htmldoc</code> and <code>phpdoc</code>
directories, have been significantly updated and expanded. In particular, 
in many places the class of each method is explicitly shown, as well as 
the type of the return value and of the arguments. This upgrade is not 
yet completed, but already covers the more relevant sections. </li>

<li>The unary minus operator in the <code>Vec4()</code> returns a 
reference to a four-vector with all components negated, but leaves 
the original four-vector unchanged. Previously the four-vector itself
was flipped.</li>

<li>The <code>pPlus()</code> and <code>pMinus()</code> methods of a
four-vector and an event-record particle are renamed <code>pPos()</code> 
and <code>pNeg()</code>, respectively.</li>

<li>Include a further loop in <code>ProcessLevel</code>, so that a new
process is generated in case of failures of a less severe nature.</li>

<li>Introduce warning message for unexpected <code>meMode</code> in
<code>ResonanceWidths</code>.</li>

<li>Les Houches event reading framework has been rearranged for
more flexibility. Some bugs corrected. Specifically, when scale 
is not set (<code>scale = -1.</code> in the Les Houches standard),
PYTHIA did not attempt to set this scale itself, which typically 
lead to there not being any ISR or FSR. Now the 
<a href="CouplingsAndScales.html" target="page">rules for normal 
1-, 2- and 3-body final states</a> are applied, with a trivial
extension of the 3-body rules for higher multiplicities.</li>

<li>Correct bug in the handling of parton densities, whereby it was
not possible to switch to a new set, once a first initialization
had been done.</li>

<li>Correct bugs when several <code>Pythia::init</code> initialization
calls are made in the same run, specifically in the case that pointers
to external processes have been handed in.

<li>Changes in main03.cmnd and main04.cmnd so that some nonstandard 
options are commented ou rather than active. Related comments
inserted also in some other .cmnd files, but there without any change 
in program execution.</li>

<li>A few further minor bug fixes.</li>

<li>Update year to 2009.</li>

</ul>
</li>
